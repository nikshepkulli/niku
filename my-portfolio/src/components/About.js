    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science, specializing in data science
      and machine learning. As a Research Assistant at Sacred Heart University,
      I've dedicated myself to advancing the field, contributing to a 50%
      reduction in laboratory accidents. My academic focus includes using
      Python, R, and SQL for projects like breast cancer prediction, sentiment
      analysis, and COVID-19 tweet modeling, achieving consistently high
      accuracy. In a Data Science Virtual Intern role at British Airways, I
      refined skills in web scraping and predictive modeling, employing tools
      such as Beautiful Soup, Scikit-learn, and Random Forest. With over four
      years as a Software Engineer at Cerner Corporation, I enhanced AI and
      ML-based life-saving technology, improved data collection frameworks, and
      streamlined workflows. Proficient in Java, C, C++, C#, JS, and big data
      technologies, I integrated Agile and semantic versioning methodologies.
      Driven by a passion for applying data science and machine learning to
      solve real-world challenges and drive business growth, I am ready to make
      meaningful contributions to the academic community and push the boundaries
      of knowledge in computer science during my Ph.D. journey.
